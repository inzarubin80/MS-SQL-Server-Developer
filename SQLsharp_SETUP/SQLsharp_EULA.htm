The demand for arbitration will be filed within a reasonable time after the controversy or claim has arisen, and in no event after the date upon which institution of legal proceedings based on such controversy or claim would be barred by the applicable statute of limitation. Such arbitration will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina before a single judicial referee sitting to determine all issues of fact and law, whether legal or equitable. The cost of arbitration shall initially be borne pro rata by the Parties, but the prevailing party shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement for its pro rata share of the reference cost, in addition to attorneys&rsquo; fees. The arbitrator shall conduct all pretrial and trial procedures and shall decide all matters legitimately in issue as if the controversy were being formally litigated in North Carolina State Court (including application of North Carolina Evidence Code (and applicable case law), North Carolina Code of Civil Procedure (and applicable case law), and all other applicable statutory and decisional law). The award through arbitration will be final and binding. Either Party may enter any such award in a court having jurisdiction or may make application to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may, without recourse to arbitration, assert against the other Party a third party claim or cross-claim in any non-collusive action brought by a third party, to which the subject matter of this Agreement may be relevant.</td>
